Exploratory Data Analysis of Historical and Future CO2 Emissions in Earth's Atmosphere. (Work in Progress)

Project Date: 11/20/2021

Project Purpose: As stated above, the intention of this project is to explore and analyze the rise in global CO2 Emissions over the past 2-3 centuries, and what factors played a role in causing this apparent rise. 

To further understand what's causing CO2 Emissions to rise, we will analyze data on topics such as:
  - Population Growth
  - Deforstation
  - Urbanization
